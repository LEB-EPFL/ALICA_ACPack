ALICA AC Pack
=============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   _javasphinx/packages

This package contains the implementations for the analyzers and
controllers in ALICA, the automatic illumination control package for
light microscopy. It is a run-time dependency of ALICA. These
implementations are maintained separately of ALICA because they are
used in SASS as well.
